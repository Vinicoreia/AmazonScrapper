# AmazonScrapper


The initial idea of this repo is to use ~~scrapy~~ node to collect and evaluate some data from amazon since amazon prime is comming.

## The finish product should contain
- A scrapper that allows tracking a product or a list of products
- Notify me by email when a product is below a value
